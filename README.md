# Creating-and-querying-a-dummy-properties-db
In this repository, i create a "dummy" relational database for an imaginary real-estate agency, and then write some queries. </br>
</br>
In *"creating_db.sql"* file, i create the the database and its tables, i fill it manualy with records (it was a uni assignment), and then i query the database.</br>
</br>
In *ER Model.jpg* the Entiry-Relationship Model of the database can be seen.</br>
</br>
In *MySQL Diagramm.jpg* the Diagram that MySQL Workbench generates for the database can be seen, showing tables and their primary and foreign keys.</br>
</br>
In *Relational Model.jpg* the Relational Model of the database can be seen showing the relations between tables and the keys that "connect" them with each other.
